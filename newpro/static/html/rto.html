The South Pennar River is known as Thenpennaiyaru in Tamil and Dakshina Pinakini in Kannada. It is also referred as Ponnaiyar .  The river originates from the South-Eastern side of the Chennakesava hills and the North-Western side of the Nandi Hills or Nandidurg  in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state. It flows for a distance of about 85 kilometres within Karnataka, to the north of Bangalore.  Just before the interstate border, excess water from Bellandur and Vartur lakes in Bangalore flows into the river and then it flows towards south east and enters Tamil Nadu at a distance of 4 kilometres to the west of Pagalur (about 50 km north west of Bagalur village of Hosur Taluk in Krishnagirir District).  It flows 400 kilometres (km) from its point of origin before joining the Bay of Bengal at Cuddalore district of Tamilnadu.
En route, its chief tributaries are the Chinnar (Markanda nadhi), Vaniyar and Pambaru rivers.  It is the sole water source in Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts.
