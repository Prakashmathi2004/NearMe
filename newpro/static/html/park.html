The South Pennar River is known as Thenpennaiyaru in Tamil and Dakshina Pinakini in Kannada. It is also referred as Ponnaiyar .  The river originates from the South-Eastern side of the Chennakesava hills and the North-Western side of the Nandi Hills or Nandidurg  in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state. It flows for a distance of about 85 kilometres within Karnataka, to the north of Bangalore.  Just before the interstate border, excess water from Bellandur and Vartur lakes in Bangalore flows into the river and then it flows towards south east and enters Tamil Nadu at a distance of 4 kilometres to the west of Pagalur (about 50 km north west of Bagalur village of Hosur Taluk in Krishnagirir District).  It flows 400 kilometres (km) from its point of origin before joining the Bay of Bengal at Cuddalore district of Tamilnadu.
En route, its chief tributaries are the Chinnar (Markanda nadhi), Vaniyar and Pambaru rivers.  It is the sole water source in Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts.

Ulagalantha Perumal Temple or Trivikrama Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu located in Tirukkoyilur, Tamil Nadu, India. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Ulagalantha Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Poongothai.[1] The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas, with later contributions from Vijayanagara kings and Madurai Nayaks. The temple covers an area of 5 acres (20,000 m2) and has a temple tower that is the third tallest in Tamil Nadu, measuring 192 ft (59 m) in height.
